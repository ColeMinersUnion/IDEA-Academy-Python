# Week 3.
A brief week for some larger topics. As the course progresses, the pace will slow, but the material becomes more in depth. This week will cover functions, the flexibility of functions in python and File Handling. 

## Keywords
`def`, `return`, `yield`, `with`, `open`, `close`, `as`, `lambda`

## Functions
We'll be going over the basics of functions in python. We'll learn how to wrap reuseable code into functions, how to use functions to make code more readable. 

### Other function Archetypes
We'll also go over other uses for functions including generators, implicit data manipulation and decorators if we have time. 

## File IO

## Type Hints
Lastly, we'll learn about Type hints, and consider the implications of integrating with large codebases.
