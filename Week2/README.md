# Week 2!
This week we're focusing on basic syntax. We'll introduce new keywords, and compile basic programs. 

## Keywords
`for`, `in`, `range`, `while`, `if`, `else`, `elif`, `True`, `False`, `Or`, `And`, `Not`, `break`, `continue`, Mathematical Operands, `input()`, `print()` and more. 

## Topics
We'll discuss the difference between for each and for loops. We will learn the benefits of looping and how to properly loop. We'll also continue with conditionals, learning the ins and outs of if statements. We'll work with basic IO using print and input.
