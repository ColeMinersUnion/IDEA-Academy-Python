# Week 7
This week we'll go over production code and best practices. There will be some reading for this week, [Python-Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/). We will also cover object oriented programming practices and more abstract programming ideas. We'll also learn about  Schema for storing data predictably. Lastly, we'll cover how to display program flows using diagrams. 

## Note to self
Do I cover docker and containerized code?
