# Week 4
In week 4, we'll cover Classes and Error handling. These are relatively simple ideas, but become increasingly complex as you dive into implementations. I'll also briefly touch on import.

## Keywords
`try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `class`, Dunder methods and `import`. 

## Classes
We'll learn about classes, how they're used and how to implement them. We'll talk about Dunder methods like `__init__`, `__new__`, `__del__` and more. While general OOP principles will be covered in week 7, inheritance will taught here. 

## Error handling
We'll learn how to raise and catch errors.
