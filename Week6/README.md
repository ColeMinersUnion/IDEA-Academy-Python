# Environment Management.
This week, we'll be talking about virtual environments, how to manage and isolate projects. We'll talk about the installation and use of external libraries. We'll also learn to create codebases, and best practices for larger projects. 

## Venv

## Libraries
We'll use three libraries this week, mostly arbitrarily chosen. Feel free to swap out a project.
