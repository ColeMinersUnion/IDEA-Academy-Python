# Requirements.

Classes for each piece. Type in algebraic notation for moves. 
Moves are checked for validity.

## To-do
~~Rook~~, ~~Bishop~~, ~~Queen~~, ~~Castling~~, En Passant, ~~Algebraic Notation Parser~~, Promotion, main loop, 

## Note to self, 
Castling does not check for checks that prevent castling.
The whole checking for checks to know if a move is legal or not still does not happen. 
Castline on a whole could be handled better
the whole checking concept needs a rework.
