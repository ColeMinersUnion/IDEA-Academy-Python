## Weekly Expectations
On each week, we'll briefly cover new topics and keywords. I'll be giving out a small handful of assignments to implement the new ideas. I will also point out where to go to learn more and find help. Throughout the week, feel free to ask questions or ask me to review the code. For project weeks, we'll have code reviews to learn how to read and disect others' code. If you miss any weeks due to actual work, feel free to use project weeks to catch up, or see me and we can do a brief overview of that week's material. 

## Please Note:
This course was made by Cole, who has spent the last 6 years coding, and may have made this course too accelerated. (I believe in you all). But at any point feel free to tell me to slow down, and explain ideas more thoroughly.
