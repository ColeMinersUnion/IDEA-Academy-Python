# Week 1
Not much python will happen in week 1. We'll be downloading Git Bash (and perhaps Github Desktop), Python and VS Code. We'll learn how to navigate our terminals, the basics of Git and how Python interracts with our PC. 

## Git
Git bash is required, we'll be setting up a repository to store changes, and forking the repository for the weeks to come. For those with some knowledge about programming, I recommend learning how to use Git from your terminal, but I know there are several engineers without much programming experience, and using Github Desktop is perfectly acceptable. 

## Python
We'll download python to run on your machine and run some basic tests to make sure that everything works as expected. 

## VS Code
VS Code will be our IDE of choice. Pycharm also works, but I'm not super familiar with the ins and outs of that IDE. Thonny, Anaconda, IDLE, Mu, and others should not be used.
